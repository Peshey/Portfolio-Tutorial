# Portfolio Tutorial

## Description

This project was a follow along in creating a web portfolio. As a new software develper I wanted to learn how to build a web portfolio and see how someone with more experience approaches writing code. I learned a lot of information that will help me in the future such as flexbox, pseudoelements, and responsive design.
